\question We want to write the statement, ``A person is popular only if they are cool or funny'', in propositional logic.
  \begin{parts}
  \part[5] Identify three simple propositions, $p, q, \text{ and } r$, needed for the representation and write out the corresponding expression that uses them to represent the given sentence.
    \begin{solution} % Complete the solution.
    \\p: popular
      \\q: cool
      \\r: funny
      \\$p \implies (q \lor r)$
      % Enter your solution here.
    \end{solution}
  \part[5] For your expression identified above, write the converse, contrapositive, and inverse in propositional logic as well as complete English sentences.
    \begin{solution} % Complete the solution.
    \\converse: $(q \lor r) \implies p$ which means if a person is cool or funny, they are popular.
      \\contrapositive: $\neg(q \lor r) \implies \neg p$ which means if a person is not cool or funny, they are not popular.
      \\inverse: $\neg p \implies \neg (q \lor r)$ which means if a person is not popular, they are not cool or funny.

\question[5] A small company makes widgets in a variety of constituent materials (aluminum, copper, iron), colors (red, green, blue, grey), and finishes (matte, textured, coated). Although there are many combinations of widget features, the company markets only a subset of the possible combinations. The following sentences are constraints that characterize the possibilities. 
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item aluminum $\lor$ copper $\lor$ iron
  \item aluminum $\implies$ grey
  \item copper $\land$ $\neg$ coated $\implies$ red
  \item coated $\land$ $\neg$ copper $\implies$ green
  \item green $\lor$ blue $\iff \neg$ textured $\land$ $\neg$ iron
  \end{enumerate}
  Suppose that a customer places an order for a copper widget that is both green and blue with a matte coating. Your job is to determine which constraints are satisfied and which are violated and provide an explanation.
  \begin{solution} % Complete the solution.
  Constraint 1 says that the widget is made of either aluminium or copper or iron. It is satisfied because the widget is made of copper. Constraint 2 says that aluminium widget implies the colour will be grey. Since the material is not aluminium, this constraint is also satisfied. Constraint 3 is not satisfied because it is copper and it is not coated but the colour is not red. Constraint 4 is correct because the antecedent is false but the consequent is true so the statement is still true. The last constraint is true because the widget is green and blue and not textured or iron.

\question[5] You are given four cards each of which has a number on one side and a letter on another. You place them on a table in front of you and the four cards read: $A\ 5\ 2\ J$. Which cards would you turn over in order to test the following rule? 
  \begin{center}
    Cards with $5$ on one side have $J$ on the other side.
  \end{center}
  Explain your choice.
  \begin{solution}
  It is implied that any card that has 5 on one side must have J on the other side. If we turn the card with 5 on one side and it has J on the other side this test will be true.
  but if we chose J there is no specification to what number is written on the other side.

\question An argument is said to be \textit{valid} if its \textit{conclusion} can be inferred from its \textit{premises}. An argument that is not valid is called an \textit{invalid} argument, or a \textit{fallacy}. For each of the arguments below, identify the simple propositions involved, write the premises and conclusion(s) in logical notation using the identified simple propositions, and decide whether it is valid. Justify your decision.

\question[5] One of your TA's has hidden a manual titled, ``Sacred Secrets: How to Earn an A+ and Keep your Mind'', somewhere on campus. As they could themselves not benefit from this manual, the directions they have left for you to find the manual are as follows.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item There is a hint at Learn Courtyard or at the Gym.
  \item If your TA is sitting in Ehsas or they are absent, then there is a hint at Learn Courtyard.
  \item If your TA is not sitting in Ehsaas, then there is a hint at the Gym.
  \item If there are people in Learn Courtyard, then there is no hint at Learn Courtyard.
  \item If there is a hint at Learn Courtyard, then the manual is at Zen Garden.
  \item If there is hint at the Gym, then the manual is at Earth Courtyard.
  \item If your TA is absent, then the manual is at Fire Courtyard.
  \end{enumerate}
  You notice that there are people in Learn Courtyard. Where is the manual?

  Identify the relevant simple propositions to model the above in propositional logic. Represent the above situation using propositional logic and describe the steps needed to infer the location of the manual.

\section*{Predicate Logic}
  
\question
  \begin{parts}
  \part[5] There is a third quantifier often used in predicate logic called the \textit{Uniqueness Quantifier}, $\exists!x\; P(x)$ which is read as, ``$P(x)$ is true for one and only one $x$ in the domain'', or ``there is a \textit{unique} $x$ such that $P(x)$''. Give an example of a propositional function $P(x)$ and a corresponding domain, such that $\exists!x\; P(x)$ is a true proposition.
    \begin{solution}
      % Enter your solution here.
      Domain = $\mathbb{R}$
      \\ $\exists!x\; P((x^2+1=2x))$
      \\ This proposition is only true when the value of x=1.
      %\ $\exists!x\; P(1)$
      
    \end{solution}
    
  \part[5] The uniqueness quantifier can be expressed using the other two quantifiers but is still used on its own as it shortens the logical terms. In particular,
    \begin{align}
      \exists!x\;  P(x) \equiv \exists x\; (P(x) \land \forall y\; (P(y) \rightarrow y = x)) \label{eq:uniq}
    \end{align}
    Express the proposition on the right above in English and explain why it is equivalent to the left hand side, i.e. to the uniquely quantified propositional function. You may explain in words; a formal proof is not yet required.
    \begin{solution}
    propositional function of y implies that y equals x for all values of y and propositional function of x is true for some values of x.
      % Enter your solution here.
    \end{solution}
    
  \part[5] Express $\neg \exists!xP\; (x)$ in a similar way as (\ref{eq:uniq}). Provide an expression in formal notation as well as in English. Also, give an example of a true proposition $\neg\exists!x\; P(x)$ by slightly changing the one you gave in part (a).
    \begin{solution}
    Domain = $\mathbb{R}$
      \\ $\neg \exists!x\; P((x^2+1=2x))$
      \\ This proposition is only true when the value of x is not equal to 1.
      \\ example of a true proposition for this expression will be x=2.
      % Enter your solution here.
    \end{solution}

\question
  For each of the statements given below, perform the following.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Express the statement in formal notation using quantifiers.
  \item Express the negation of the statement in formal notation such that no negation is left to the quantifier.

    \begin{solution}
    \\ 1. All values of x are equal to some values of $y^2$
    \\2. False. It does not hold true for negative values. If value of x is -1, value of $y^2$ can never be -1
    \\ 3. Domain is true for positive integers only

  \part[5] $\exists x \forall y\; (x \leq y^2)$
    \begin{solution}
    \\ 1. Some values of x are less than equal to $y^2$
    \\2.True. $y^2$ will always be greater than x for all integers
    \\3. It will be false if the domain was all real numbers

  \part[5] $\forall x \forall y\ \exists z\; (x-z=y)$
    \begin{solution}
    \\1. All values of x when subtracted by some values of z will give all values of y.  
    \\2. True There will always exist a value of z that would fill the difference between the value of x and the value of y
    \\3. Over all false will occur if domain is limited to only positive or only negative integers
